This is a suite of various codes necessary for reading out the TTL signal from a typical Geiger-Muller detector by an Arduino microprocessor.  
The suite consists of two codes:

 * Arduino code for detecting the TTL pulse, and transfering the timestamp of the pulse to the computer over the serial protocol
 * Python code for reading in the serial data from the Arduino
